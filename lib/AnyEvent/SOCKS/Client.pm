=head1 SYNOPSIS

Constructs function which behave like AnyEvent::Socket::tcp_connect

    use AnyEvent::SOCKS::Client qw/tcp_connect_via/;

	$AnyEvent::SOCKS::Client::TIMEOUT = 30; 
	# used only if prepare_cb NOT passed to proxied function
	# e.g. AE::HTTP on_prepare callback is not present

    my @chain = qw/socks5://user:pass@192.0.2.100:1080 socks5://198.51.100.200:9080/;
    tcp_connect_via( @chain )->( 'example.com', 80, sub{
        my ($fh) = @_ or die "Connect failed $!";
		...
    }); 

SOCKS client for AnyEvent::HTTP

   http_get "http://example.com/foo", 
      tcp_connect => tcp_connect_via('socks5://198.51.100.200:9080'), 
      sub{ 
         my( $data, $header) = @_ ;
         ...
      };

=head1 SECURITY

By default resolves names on SOCKS server. No DNS leaks.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS 

=head2 $sub = tcp_connect_via( @proxy_uris )

Function accepts proxy list and return proxied tcp_connect function. See AnyEvent::Socket docs for more information about its semantics.

=head1 Errors and logging

Module uses AE::log for error reporting. You can use "error" or "debug" levels to get more information about errors.
